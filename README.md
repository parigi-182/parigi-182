## Hello there 👋

# Enrico Parigi

Hi, I'm Enri. I graduated in Computer Science at the University of Turin in July 2024.  
I'm interested in low-level programming, systems, and computer networks.

## 📂 Public Repositories

### 🔐 [Browser Hardening – Bachelor Thesis](https://github.com/parigi-182/My-Browser-Hardening-Bachelor-Thesis)

A Python-based crawler that launches Firefox, Chrome and Edge in controlled environments.  
It captures cookies, modifies them, and analyzes server responses to understand cookie validation mechanisms across browsers.  
Focus areas: automation (Selenium), browser internals, session management, and security testing.

### 🚢 [Maritime Trade Simulation](https://github.com/parigi-182/Maritime-Trade-Simulation)

Final project for the Operating Systems course.  
Simulates a seaport with multiple ships, docks, and loading operations using multithreading and resource sharing.  
Key features:
- Thread pools for job scheduling
- Mutexes and condition variables for access control
- Simulated delays and logging
- Good modular structure and command-line configuration

### 🧠 [Lispy](https://github.com/parigi-182/Lispy)

A small Lisp interpreter written in C using the `mpc.h` parser combinator library.  
Supports:
- S-expressions and Q-expressions
- Arithmetic operations
- Symbols and function dispatch
A solid exercise in recursive parsing, memory management, and interpreter architecture.

### 🌐 [Network Simulator](https://github.com/parigi-182/Network_Simulator_Java)

A “just for fun” personal project inspired by the Computer Networks course.  
Implements basic protocol mechanics and packet-level simulation logic (in early stages).

## 💻 Other Projects (Not Public)

- **Java email server/client**: Final assignment for Programming 3.  
  Multithreaded mail server with multiple clients over sockets. Handles basic commands and user session management.

- **Bytecode translator**: A small interpreter/compiler that parses pseudo-code and generates Java bytecode compatible with `jasmine.jar`.  
  (Yes, it's technically a compiler.)

- **Emergency B&B website**: Quick deployment using a paid Bootstrap theme, PHP scripts, and booking engine integration for a friend’s small business.  
  Nothing fancy, just working code under pressure.

## 🤓 Side Notes

- Used to mod Android phones, flash custom ROMs, and experiment with Linux distributions.
- Built and maintained a couple of PCs from scratch.
- Most comfortable working close to the system or solving low-level problems.
- I like understanding *how* things work, not just *what* to write.
